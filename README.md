## Weather and Itinerary Results
1) A database (.csv file) of 694 randomly selected cities was created that included information on latitude/longitude, maximum temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and current weather description.

2) A travel destinations map was created from the database based on customer temperature preferences for a travel destination.  This included a marker layer map with a pop-up for each city that included weather information.

3) A travel itinerary map with pop-up markers with hotel information was included for the specific travel itinerary.
